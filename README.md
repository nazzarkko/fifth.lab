# It`s my fifth lab. Here we have 5 candidates for elections. I create
a program that allows the user to enter the names of five candidates 
in local elections and the number of votes received by each candidate 
(class Candidate) and class Elections, which contains a set of candidates
 and can calculate the winner of the election. The program then displays the name of each candidate,
 the number of votes received and the percentage of the total number of votes.
